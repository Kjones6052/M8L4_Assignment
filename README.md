# **Hello, World**

The files in this repository are my assignment for CSS Advanced Properties, Module 8 Lesson 4.

All code sections which complete a specific task will have a note to indicate what task is being completed by the code below it. For instance, 
"<!-- all html code notes will appear like this in the html document -->" and "/* all css code notes will appear like this */".

Tasks Completed with Details:
Part 1 Task 1 - For this task I created a webpage that uses a background image to cover the full web page. This image is placed to show transparency effects to elements on the page. Then, a class in styles.css was created called  'background-fade' which was applied the the div element which contains all the elements for the webpage. This class was styled to have a light blue background color using rgba that is partially transparent to allow someone to still see the background image for the web page.

Part 1 Task 2 - For this task I created a H1 Header element with white text, and applied a text shadow effect using rgba to apply the color and opacity to the text shadow to enhance the visibility and text readability.

Part 1 Task 3 - For this task I create a button with a solid color using rgba. After this, I applied a hover effect for the button that changed both the text color of the text within the button as well as changing the background color of the button to enhance user interaction with the button when a user uses a mouse cursor to hover over the button.

Part 2 Task 1 - For this task I created a hyperlink within the div element which will lead a user to CodingTemple.com when clicked, and for visability and readability I made the text color of the link white to match the header. Then I applied a hover effect to this link that changed the text color in the link from white to black so that it still stands out against the background color for the div element. 

Part 2 Task 2 - For this task I used the same button that was created for Part 1 Task 3. With this button I created an animation that gets applied whenever a user clicks on the button. The animation applied increased the size of the button slightly while the button is being clicked, and then automatically returns to its original size after releasing the click. 

Part 2 Task 3 - For this task I inserted a peace sign icon into a new paragraph and made the icon large enough to see clearly. I then added an animation effect to the peace sign icon that continuously rotates the peace sign whie you are on the page. 

Additional information about this webpage:
All elements put on into the web page are located within the same div element to make the size of the element larger and easier to see the effects of the transparent background color on top of the full size background image. All of the text, buttons, links, and icons are aligned in the center of the page to make them easier to see and interact with.

Thank you, and enjoy!
